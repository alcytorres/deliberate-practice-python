# 4. Find Pair with Target Difference
"""
Task: Find two numbers in an array whose difference is a given target. The larger number minus the smaller should equal the target.
Example: [1, 3, 5, 8], target = 2 â†’ [1, 3]
Why: Prepares for Two Sum by practicing pointer movement for a condition.

# Sort array in ascending order to use two pointers effectively
# Set 'left' to 0 and 'right' to 1 (start with adjacent elements)
# Loop until 'right' reaches the end of the array
# Calculate difference between elements at right and left
# Check if the difference matches the target
# Return the pair if target is found
# If difference is too small
# Move 'right' forward to increase the difference
# If difference is too large
# Move 'left' forward to decrease the difference
# If pointers overlap after moving 'left'
# Move 'right' forward to keep them distinct
# Return None if no pair is found
