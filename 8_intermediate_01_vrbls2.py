# Insert a variable into a string using either concatenation or interpolation


# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

first_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"
# print(first_name + " " + last_name)


# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

first_name = "Mark"
last_name = "Smith"
# print(f"{first_name} {last_name}")


# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# if word == "marco":
    # print("polo")

# Solution with infinite loop
# while True:
#     word = input("Enter a word: ")
#     if word == "marco":
#         print("polo")
#         break


# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

color1 = "blue"
color2 = "white"
color3 = "black"
# print("The three colors are " + color1 + ", " + color2 + ", and " + color3 + ".")

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

color1 = "blue"
color2 = "white"
color3 = "red"
# print(f"The three colors are {color1}, {color2}, and {color3}")


# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# name = input("What is your name? ")
# if name != "Santa":
#     print("You're not Santa.")

# Solution with infinite loop
# while True:
#     name = input("What is your name? ")
#     if name != "Santa":
#         print("You're not Santa.")
#     else:
#         print("You are Santa.")
#         break


# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

title = "How to fly"
author = "Mike Santana"
# print("The author of " + title + " is " + author + ".")


# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

title = "How to fly"
author = "Mike Santana"
# print(f"The author of {title} is {author}")

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# word = input("Enter a password ")
# if word == "Joshua":
#     print("Shall we play a game?")
# else:
#     print("Access denied")


# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

city1 = "Chicago"
city2 = "New York"
city3 = "San Francisco"
# print(city1 + ", " + city2 + ", and " + city3 + " are 3 major cities in the United States.")
