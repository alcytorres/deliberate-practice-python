# Write nested conditionals


# 1. Write a program that stores a customer's age and a movie's time in two separate variables. Then calculate the price of a movie ticket based on the following conditions:

# If the age is 12 years old or younger, the ticket price is $5.
# If the age is between 13 and 59 years old and the movie is before 6 PM, the ticket price is $7. After 6 PM, the ticket price is $10.
# If the customer is 60 years old or older, the ticket price is $7.


age = 17
time = 23



# 2. Write a program to store the type of book (regular, reference, or special collection) and the number of days its overdue. Then calculate the fine amount based on the following conditions:

# If the book is a regular book and overdue by up to 7 days, the fine is $1 per day.
# If the book is a regular book and overdue by more than 7 days, the fine is $2 per day.
# If the book is a reference book, there is no fine, regardless of the number of days overdue.
# If the book is a special collection book, the fine is $5 per day, regardless of the number of days overdue.


book_type = "special collection"
days_overdue = 10
fine_amount = 0



# 3. Write a program that stores a person's order value and membership level (regular or premium). Then calculate a discount amount based on the following conditions:

# If the total order value is less than $50, there is no discount.
# If the total order value is between $50 and $100, the discount is 5% for regular customers and 10% for premium customers.
# If the total order value is greater than $100, the discount is 10% for regular customers and 15% for premium customers.


order_value = 1000
membership = "regular"




# Mistake Explanation: Forgot to add "end".
  # One time I forgot to add the first end "end".
  # My mistake was nesting the elsif order_value > 100 inside the elsif order_value > 50 && order_value < 100 block, causing it to only check values between 50 and 100, and skip anything over 100 (like 1000).
  # It should be a separate, top-level condition.


# 4. Write a Ruby program that stores the weight of a package and the destination (domestic or international). Then calculate the shipping fee based on the following conditions:

# If the destination is domestic:
# If the weight is less than or equal to 1 kg, the shipping fee is $5.
# If the weight is greater than 1 kg, the shipping fee is $10.
# If the destination is an international shipment:
# If the weight is less than or equal to 1 kg, the shipping fee is $15.
# If the weight is greater than 1 kg, the shipping fee is $25.


destination = "domestic"
weight = 4
shipping_fee = 0
